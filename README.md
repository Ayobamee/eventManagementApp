#Issues with first time installation/execution of the cypress on mac using default project from my Github and solution
1. Ensure you are running node version v18.19.1, to check this go to terminal and run the commnad node -v, if a lower node version is shown run nvm install 18 , if you had an old version eg 15 run nvm uninstall 15 and install 18 and run nvm use 18.
2. Navigate to project and update the preprocessor by running npm install @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor@latest --save-dev
3. Remove the node modules, by navigating to the file directory and deleting the node module folder.
4. Run npm install, and reinstall the node modules.
5. Run npx cypress open and run your tests.
6. Ensure that your variable in your Secrets in Github actions aligns with how you call it in your .yml ie if you use CYPRESS_USERNAME in secrets, in the .yml it should be called using secrets.CYPRESS_USERNAME, if the names do not match, you would have issues running your tests.
7. Use 'git remote remove origin' to remove origin if you need to
